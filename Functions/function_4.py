# Write a program that asks the user to enter a distance in kilometers, 
# then converts that distance to miles. The conversion formula is as follows:

km = int(input("Enter the distance in km: "))
miles = miles = km * 0.6214

def convert(km):
    print(f"{km} km is {round(miles,2)} miles")

def main():
    convert(km)

main()
